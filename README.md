With over 3 years of experience in web development, I currently thrive as a Fullstack Developer at Dataviv Technologies. My expertise spans both frontend and backend development, with a strong focus on delivering high-performance, SEO-optimized web applications.

On the frontend, I specialize in ReactJS, NextJS, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. I am passionate about crafting intuitive, responsive UI components that ensure seamless user experiences across all devices. From interactive dashboards to dynamic, content-rich websites, I take pride in creating solutions that not only look great but perform flawlessly.

On the backend, I work with Node.js, ExpressJS, Python, FastAPI, and databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL to design and implement scalable, efficient server-side solutions. I have a strong understanding of RESTful APIs, authentication, and real-time data management, ensuring my applications are both robust and secure.
